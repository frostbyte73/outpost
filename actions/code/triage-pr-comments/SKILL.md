# PR maintainer

This is the same session that implemented the PR, resumed now that review comments have arrived — you already have the full context of the change in this conversation. Your job for this round: for each comment, decide reply / edit / ignore, write a one-line rationale, and pre-draft a reply. The envelope re-states the comments and the original goal so you stay grounded even if the conversation was compacted; lean on your own memory of the code first, and use the envelope as the refresher.

**You only recommend. You do not edit files. You do not post comments.** Editing is the `code.fix-pr-comment` round's job; posting replies is `code.reply-pr-comments`'s, once the user has approved them at the gate the daemon forces on that round. `code.orchestrate-pr` can do neither — it has no write grant at all.

## Step 1 — Read the envelope

```bash
cat "$OUTPOST_ENVELOPE"
```

Relevant fields:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `jobId`, `stepId` | Identifiers — POST them back. |
| `job.title`, `job.description`, `job.externalRef.url` | Original ticket context. |
| `goal`, `inputs.approach`, `inputs.risks` | The original spec for this step. Ground reply decisions in this. |
| `previousSteps[]` | Earlier `action` steps' `output` strings (only those with `forwardOutput: true`). High-signal context for grounding reply decisions. |
| `workspace.repoCwd`, `workspace.branch` | Parent repo path + branch name (your cwd is the worktree). |
| `pr.comments` | Every comment on the PR. Each: `{id, author, body, createdAt, file?, line?, diffHunk?, url?, inReplyTo?, respondedAt?}`. Skip any with `respondedAt`, any already covered by `artifacts.draftedReplies`, and **any this session already replied to** — a reply posted by an earlier `code.reply-pr-comments` round comes back as a new comment on the next watcher sweep, and `artifacts.postedReplies` is the record of which those are. Triaging your own reply is an infinite loop. |
| `boundNote` | Which comments the controller wants triaged this round, if it narrowed the set. |
| `recentLessons` | Short lessons you wrote at the end of past code.triage-pr-comments runs. Skim them before drafting — they encode patterns about this reviewer or repo. |

```bash
jq -r '.recentLessons[]? | "[\(.outcome)] \(.lesson)"' "$OUTPOST_ENVELOPE"
```

```bash
JOB_ID=$(jq -r '.jobId' "$OUTPOST_ENVELOPE")
STEP_ID=$(jq -r '.stepId' "$OUTPOST_ENVELOPE")
PENDING=$(jq -c '[.pr.comments[]? | select(.respondedAt | not)]' "$OUTPOST_ENVELOPE")
```

`DAEMON_AUTH` and `OUTPOST_HOOK_PORT` are inherited from the original session spawn.

## Step 2 — Decide

For each comment in `pendingComments`:

**Pick `edit` when** the reviewer's concern is best resolved by changing code. "Good catch, this is broken — fix it" is `edit`, not `reply` + paragraph explaining the fix. The user can still override into Reply if they disagree, but your recommendation should match what serves the PR best.

**Pick `reply` when** you are disputing the comment — the reviewer is wrong, or the trade-off they are questioning was deliberate — or when you are declaring it out of scope for this PR. Answering a direct question counts as a reply only when the answer is one of those two: it tells the reviewer something the pushed diff cannot.

**A reply never agrees.** "You're correct", "good catch", "will fix", "nice catch — updated", "done in the next push" — agreement is an `edit` when the code should change and an `ignore` when it shouldn't, never a `reply`. Every reply costs the user an approval on a public PR, and one that concedes a point the reviewer already made spends it on nothing the diff won't say better. If the first clause of your draft concedes, the recommendation is wrong — don't reword it, change it.

**Pick `ignore` when** the comment is pure social affirmation ("nice work!"), already addressed by an intervening edit, or otherwise has no actionable content — including one you simply agree with and have nothing to add to. Note that "ignore" here means "mark resolved internally" — it does not touch GitHub's resolved-thread state.

Always include a rationale. One sentence. Cite the comment text or thread state ("reviewer is asking about the migration path, not the implementation"). The rationale appears under every thread in the UI, so be specific — *"recommend reply — answer the question"* helps no one.

**Draft a reply wherever you can honestly dispute or scope out the comment**, including on an `edit` or `ignore` the user might override into Reply — that draft is what they'll see in the composer. Where you can't, leave `draftReply` empty. A blank composer is a better answer than a manufactured concession, which is the one thing that will definitely be skipped.

If you need the current diff to ground a recommendation:

```bash
git fetch origin && git diff origin/main..HEAD
```

**Never write scratch JSON (or any non-source files) into the worktree.** Use `/tmp/` for anything you need to materialize. Pipe through stdin where possible: `echo "$PENDING" | jq ...`.

Each draft:

```json
{
  "commentId": "<the id from pendingComments verbatim>",
  "recommendation": "reply" | "edit" | "ignore",
  "rationale": "<= 240 chars",
  "draftReply": "<reply body, or empty string for pure affirmations>",
  "confidence": "high" | "medium" | "low"
}
```

`confidence` is optional but strongly encouraged — it's how sure you are that `recommendation` is the right call. Reserve `low` for genuinely ambiguous threads (reviewer intent unclear, conflicting signals in `previousSteps`, or a domain judgment call outside what the diff/ticket tell you); most decisions should be `high` or `medium`. The user's Reply composer surfaces this so they know which threads to double-check before approving.

**Examples:**

*Reviewer says "this race condition could double-charge — wrap in a transaction":*
```json
{ "commentId": "...", "recommendation": "edit", "rationale": "Reviewer flagged a real bug (double-charge race); a reply alone doesn't help.", "draftReply": "", "confidence": "high" }
```

*Reviewer asks "why are we polling here instead of using the existing event?":*
```json
{ "commentId": "...", "recommendation": "reply", "rationale": "Reviewer is asking why, not requesting a change; needs an answer.", "draftReply": "The event isn't emitted on the migration path — `cmd/migrate.go` writes directly without going through the publisher. Polling is the workaround until we fix that separately.", "confidence": "high" }
```

*Reviewer suggests caching, you don't think it's worth it:*
```json
{ "commentId": "...", "recommendation": "reply", "rationale": "Pushback — explain why the cache isn't worth it given call rate.", "draftReply": "Skipping the cache here — this path runs once per session startup and the underlying call is ~3ms on the hot CockroachDB connection. Adding a cache would mean wiring invalidation through the config-reload listener, which doesn't pay for itself at this call rate.", "confidence": "medium" }
```

*Pure affirmation:*
```json
{ "commentId": "...", "recommendation": "ignore", "rationale": "Pure social affirmation — no actionable content.", "draftReply": "", "confidence": "high" }
```

When you do write a draftReply, keep it short (1–3 sentences) and specific. Cite filenames, line numbers, or measurements when they exist.

## Step 3 — Submit replies

The outpost MCP tools are deferred behind ToolSearch — load `submit_step_progress` (and `submit_journal`) first:

```
ToolSearch({ query: "select:mcp__outpost__submit_step_progress,mcp__outpost__submit_journal", max_results: 2 })
```

If the tool doesn't come back, halt. The daemon will not scrape the transcript.

Report the drafts as a markdown artifact — one section per comment, each carrying the
comment id, your recommendation, the rationale, and the drafted reply verbatim:

```
mcp__outpost__submit_step_progress({
  jobId: "<$JOB_ID>",
  stepId: "<$STEP_ID>",
  phase: "pr_comments",
  memo: "<how many comments, the split by recommendation, anything you're unsure of>",
  artifacts: { draftedReplies: "<your drafts as markdown>" },
  next: { kind: "self-round" }
})
```

`next: {kind:"self-round"}` with no `action` hands the session back to `code.orchestrate-pr` for a decision turn. It owns the ladder — which round runs next, and whether the user is asked to approve anything — so do not pick that yourself.

Then write a one-line summary in chat: how many decisions, breakdown by kind, any uncertainty for the human.

## Step 4 — Journal one lesson

Before exiting, call `mcp__outpost__submit_journal` with one short lesson the *next* code.triage-pr-comments run should know. Skip entirely if there's nothing new.

```
mcp__outpost__submit_journal({
  action: "code.triage-pr-comments",
  jobId: "<$JOB_ID>",
  stepId: "<$STEP_ID>",
  outcome: "drafted" | "all-ignored" | "blocked",
  lesson: "<= 300 chars; concrete; what would surprise next-run-me?"
})
```

**Always journal a blocker** — a denied tool call, an allowlist gap, a missing or
ambiguous envelope field, anything you had to guess at or work around. Journal it even
when you recovered and the step succeeded: it recurs identically on every future run of
this action until a human sees it, and this journal is the only place
`meta.improve-actions` looks. Name the exact command or field, not the category.

Reviewer-specific lessons are gold ("@avichalp consistently asks for benchmarks on perf claims — pre-draft them"). Don't pad.

## Step 5 — Exit

This round doesn't wait for approval. `code.orchestrate-pr` takes the next decision turn on this same session: it binds a `code.reply-pr-comments` round for the `reply` drafts (the daemon gates that round, showing the user the exact bodies before anything is posted) and a `code.fix-pr-comment` round for the ones that need code changes.

That makes `artifacts.draftedReplies` the payload a human reads and approves verbatim, not a note to a teammate. Put each comment's id, recommendation, rationale and drafted reply in it plainly — the reply body must be postable exactly as written.

## Failure modes

- **Envelope missing or unreadable.** Something went wrong upstream — exit with a brief error; the orchestrator will respawn on the next watcher tick.
- **A comment got deleted between read and decide.** Skip it — the orchestrator will see it's gone on the next watcher tick.
- **Hook server returns 401.** Daemon restarted mid-session. There's no recovery — print the situation and exit; the orchestrator will respawn on the next watcher cycle.
