# write.run-github-workflow

Dispatch one GitHub Actions workflow and wait for it to finish. Returns whether
the run succeeded, its URL/id, timing, and — on failure — the failed-step logs.

This is an **external write**: `gh workflow run` triggers real CI, which may
deploy, publish, or mutate infrastructure. It follows the shared draft/commit protocol — see
`~/.outpost/actions/SHARED-write-drafts.md` for the full mechanics (this action has no
`Read`/`Grep` grant — `cat` the absolute path instead, reachable via `core`'s `^cat ` pattern).
This is a standalone action step, so `writeGate` is at `typePayload.writeGate` in
`$OUTPOST_ENVELOPE`.
`retries: 0` is set deliberately — a retry would fire the workflow a second time, and a retry
of an already-approved draft is not something to attempt on your own initiative either.

## Step 1 — read inputs

```bash
cat "$OUTPOST_ENVELOPE"
```

The envelope's `inputs` field:

| Field | Required | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `workflow` | yes | The workflow to run — its file name (`deploy.yml`), its display name, or its numeric id. Passed straight to `gh workflow run`. |
| `ref` | yes | Branch or tag to run the workflow on (e.g. `main`, `release/1.4`). The workflow's `.yml` must exist on this ref, and `workflow_dispatch` must be enabled. |
| `repo` | no | `owner/name`, informational only — **the dispatch always targets the checkout this step runs in.** If `repo` names a different repo than `workspace.repoCwd`, do not dispatch: fail the step (Step 6) saying the two disagree. |
| `inputs` | no | Object of `workflow_dispatch` input name → value. Each becomes a `-f name=value` flag. |
| `expect_conclusion` | no | Terminal conclusion that counts as success. Default `success`. |
| `workspace` | no | `{repoCwd}` — the checkout the dispatch runs against. This is what decides the repo. |

**If `inputs` is missing** (older plans), fall back to the envelope's top-level
`goal`/`title`/`description` to identify the workflow and ref, and note the
assumption in your output. If you cannot determine a workflow name AND a ref,
do not guess — submit a failed step (see Step 6) explaining what was missing.

You run in the checkout at `workspace.repoCwd`, and `gh` infers the repo from it. Confirm
that is the intended repo before drafting:

```bash
gh repo view --json nameWithOwner
```

## Step 2 — draft the dispatch (`typePayload.writeGate` absent, or `phase === "draft"`)

Compose the exact dispatch — do **not** run it.

Write every value literally into the command (the workflow name, `--ref`, and each `-f`
pair) — no `$VAR`. **No `--repo`.** The dispatch is only ever drafted in this shape: a
literal workflow name, `--ref <literal>`, and literal `-f name=value` inputs — no other flag.
`--repo` would let one approved "run deploy.yml on main" fire a deploy, release, or infra
pipeline in any repo the token can reach; leaving it out is what binds the dispatch to the
checkout the user was shown.

```
mcp__outpost__submit_write_draft({
  jobId: "<$JOB_ID>", stepId: "<$STEP_ID>",
  summary: "Dispatch <workflow> on <ref>" + (inputs ? " with <inputs>" : ""),
  calls: [{ label: "dispatch", bash: "gh workflow run \"<workflow>\" --ref \"<ref>\" -f key1=value1 -f key2=value2" }]
})
```

Then stop. If `typePayload.writeGate.feedback` is non-empty (the user proposed a different
workflow/ref/inputs — every round, oldest first), revise the command to address every point
and submit again.

## Step 3 — commit: dispatch, then find the run id (`typePayload.writeGate.phase === "commit"`)

Record a UTC dispatch timestamp and the pre-dispatch run ids first — you'll need both to
disambiguate the run the approved dispatch creates:

```bash
gh run list --workflow "<workflow>" --branch "<ref>" --event workflow_dispatch \
  --limit 20 --json databaseId,createdAt,status
```

Then run `typePayload.writeGate.approvedCalls` **verbatim** — the exact dispatch command the
user approved, unchanged even if you'd phrase it differently now. Pin matching is exact command
text, so copy the string out of `approvedCalls` itself rather than retyping it from memory —
retyping risks a spelling that no longer matches (e.g. dropping the quotes below) and gets
denied on a payload that was already approved:

```bash
gh workflow run "<workflow>" --ref "<ref>" -f key1=value1 -f key2=value2
```

`gh workflow run` prints a confirmation but **does not** return the run id. Poll `gh run
list` (same filter as above) until a run appears that is NOT in the pre-dispatch id set —
that's your run. If several appear, pick the one whose `createdAt` is newest and after your
dispatch timestamp. Grab its `databaseId`.

If no new run shows up within ~60s of dispatching, the workflow likely rejected
the dispatch (wrong ref, `workflow_dispatch` not enabled, missing required
input). Capture the error and submit a failed step (Step 6).

## Step 4 — wait for completion

The run can take seconds to hours. Prefer `gh run watch`, which polls
server-side and blocks until the run reaches a terminal state:

```bash
gh run watch <databaseId> --interval 60 --exit-status
```

`--exit-status` makes `gh` exit non-zero when the run's conclusion is not
`success`. Because a single tool call is time-bounded, a very long run may
outlast one `gh run watch` invocation — that's fine: re-check with

```bash
gh run view <databaseId> --json status,conclusion,htmlUrl,startedAt,updatedAt
```

and, while `status` is not `completed`, call `gh run watch` again (it resumes
from the current state). Do not busy-wait with `sleep`; let `gh run watch` do
the blocking, or the Monitor tool if available.

## Step 5 — report the result

Once `status == completed`, read `conclusion`. Success = `conclusion` equals
`expect_conclusion` (default `success`). On any other conclusion
(`failure`, `cancelled`, `timed_out`, …), pull the failed-step logs:

```bash
gh run view <databaseId> --log-failed
```

Load the outpost MCP tool — it's deferred behind ToolSearch:

```
ToolSearch({ query: "select:mcp__outpost__submit_step_output", max_results: 1 })
```

If it doesn't come back, halt — the daemon marks the step failed when your turn
ends. Do NOT try to return the result as your final chat message; the daemon
does not scrape transcripts.

Then submit a structured result:

```
mcp__outpost__submit_step_output({
  jobId: "<$JOB_ID>",
  stepId: "<$STEP_ID>",
  output: "{\"ok\": true, \"conclusion\": \"success\", \"runId\": 1234567890, \"url\": \"https://github.com/owner/name/actions/runs/1234567890\", \"workflow\": \"deploy.yml\", \"ref\": \"main\", \"durationSec\": 842, \"summary\": \"deploy.yml on main succeeded in 14m\"}"
})
```

On failure, set `ok: false`, include the `conclusion`, and put the trimmed
failed-step logs in a `failureLog` field with a one-line `summary`. Keep the log
excerpt focused on the erroring step — the next planner pass reads it to decide
whether to retry, fix, or abandon.

If dispatch itself failed (Step 3) so no run exists, prefer
`mcp__outpost__submit_step_failed` (load it the same way) with a message naming
the missing/invalid input; fall back to `submit_step_output` with
`{"ok": false, ...}` if that tool isn't available.

Stop after submitting. Do not commit, push, comment, or trigger anything else —
this action's only side effect is the one workflow dispatch.

## Before you exit — journal a blocker

`submit_journal` is deferred behind ToolSearch:

```
ToolSearch({ query: "select:mcp__outpost__submit_journal", max_results: 1 })
```

```
mcp__outpost__submit_journal({
  action: "write.run-github-workflow",
  jobId: "<$JOB_ID>",
  stepId: "<$STEP_ID>",
  outcome: "succeeded" | "failed" | "blocked",
  lesson: "<= 300 chars; concrete; what would surprise next-run-me?"
})
```

**Always journal a blocker** — a denied tool call, an allowlist gap, a missing or
ambiguous envelope field, a documented command that didn't exist, anything you had to
guess at or work around. Journal it even when you recovered and the step succeeded. These
recur identically on every future run of this action until a human sees them, and this
journal is the only place `meta.improve-actions` looks.

Name the exact command or field. "`git clone` denied — this action's `allowlist.json` has
no clone rule" is actionable; "permissions were too tight" is not. Skip the journal only
when the run was genuinely unremarkable; don't pad.
